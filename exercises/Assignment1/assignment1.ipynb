The concept can be described as [visual crowding](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070834/). So, highly detailed charts with numerous data points, overlapping lines, and minimal contrast. Elements that are too small, too similar in color, or too densely arranged is complicated for the eye to grasp.\n",
